## Introduction

This document is the normative specification for the overall technical architecture of the ToIP Technology Sstack. A conceptual diagram of this four-layer, two-sided architecture for decentralized digital trust infrastructure is shown in ![Figure 1](/images/ToIPDualStack.jpg "Figure 1: Conceptial Diagram of the ToIP Stack").

This specification is a deliverable of the [Technology Stack Working Group](https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Technology+Stack+Working+Group) at the [Trust oover IP (ToIP) Foundation](https://www.trustoverip.org/). It is recommended to read this document in conjunction with three other deliverables from the ToIP Foundation:

- [Introduction to ToIP](https://www.trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/Introduction-to-ToIP-V2.0-2021-11-17.pdf) is our white paper that provides an overall introduction to the market needs that have led to the emergence of decentralized digital trust infrastructure, the origin and basic structure of the ToIP stack, and the mission and activities of the ToIP Foundation.

- [Design Principles for the ToIP Stack](https://www.trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/Design-Principles-for-the-ToIP-Stack-V1.0-2022-01-17.pdf) enumerates the set of design principles informing, guiding, and constraining the design of the ToIP stack.

- [ToIP Governance Architecture Specification](https://wiki.trustoverip.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=71241) defines the overall requirements for ToIP-compliant governance frameworks.

As with all ToIP deliverables, the ToIP Foundation invites your feedback and suggestions. Please contact us via any of the channels listed on the [ToIP Foundation](https://www.trustoverip.org/) website.
