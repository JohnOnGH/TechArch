## Introduction

The mission of the Trust over IP (ToIP) Foundation is to define an overall architecture for Internet-scale digital trust that combines cryptographic assurance at the machine layers (technology) with human accountability at the business, legal, and social layers (governance). Together these two halves form a complete four-layer architecture for decentralized digital trust infrastructure known as the [ToIP stack](https://trustoverip.github.io/toip/glossary#toip-stack), illustrated in Figure 1.

This document is the normative specification for the high level architecture of the ToIP technology stack (the left half of Figure 1).  It is a deliverable of the [Technology Stack Working Group](https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Technology+Stack+Working+Group) at the [ToIP Foundation](https://www.trustoverip.org/). It is recommended to read this document in conjunction with three other deliverables from the ToIP Foundation:

1 [Introduction to ToIP](https://www.trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/Introduction-to-ToIP-V2.0-2021-11-17.pdf) is our white paper that provides an overall introduction to the market needs leading to the emergence of decentralized digital trust infrastructure. It explains the origin and basic structure of the ToIP stack together with the mission and activities of the ToIP Foundation.

1 [Design Principles for the ToIP Stack](https://www.trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/Design-Principles-for-the-ToIP-Stack-V1.0-2022-01-17.pdf) enumerates the set of design principles informing, guiding, and constraining the design of the ToIP stack.

1 [ToIP Governance Architecture Specification](https://wiki.trustoverip.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=71241) defines the overall requirements for ToIP-compliant governance frameworks.

As with all ToIP deliverables, the ToIP Foundation invites your feedback and suggestions. Please contact us via any of the channels listed on the [ToIP Foundation](https://www.trustoverip.org/) website.

## Terminology

In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL", when appearing in ALL CAPITALS, are to be interpreted as described in [IETF RFC 2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119).

All other defined terms are linked to their definitions in the applicable [ToIP glossary](https://trustoverip.github.io/toip/glossary) following the process defined by the [ToIP Concepts and Terminology Working Group](https://wiki.trustoverip.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=65700).
